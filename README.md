# CASE STUDY
Social Buzz was founded by two former engineers from a large social media conglomerate, one
from London and the other from San Francisco.

Due to their rapid growth and digital nature of their core product, the amount of data that they
create, collect and must analyze is huge. Every day over 100,000 pieces of content, ranging
from text, images, videos and GIFs are posted.

You’ve been assigned to a new project and the first thing you must do is get up to speed with the 
business problem that this project is tackling, the requirements that need to be fulfilled as 
deliverables and the alignment of internal teams with the client. 
You will be working within a large team at Accenture and there will be several people on your
team doing different roles to make this project a success. 

As a data analyst, it is imperative that you have a solid understanding of the project as quickly as possible. 
A data analyst sits between the business and the data, so it’s important that you have a deep understanding from both sides to provide insights. 

You need to use the client brief to:

* Understand the client and business problem at hand.

* Identify the requirements that need to be delivered for this project.

* Identify which tasks you should focus on.

* To make sure that you have understood the project, you will be tested on an outline of the business problem, the requirements and the delegation of tasks.

The goal is to categorize top perfomring contents on the platform by users while maintatining appropriate data practices for data collection and use.
