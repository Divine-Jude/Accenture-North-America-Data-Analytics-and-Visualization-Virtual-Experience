# Case study
Social Buzz was founded by two former engineers from a large social media conglomerate, one
from London and the other from San Francisco.

Due to their rapid growth and digital nature of their core product, the amount of data that they
create, collect and must analyze is huge. Every day over 100,000 pieces of content, ranging
from text, images, videos and GIFs are posted.

One of Accenture’s Managing Directors, Mae Mulligan, is the client lead for Social Buzz.
She has reviewed the brief provided by Social Buzz and has assembled a diverse team of Accenture experts to deliver the project.
Mae has scheduled a project kick off call with the internal Accenture project team for tomorrow morning.
Ahead of the call, Mae has shared the project brief so you can get up to speed on what Social Buzz need help with.

# Data analysis process
There is a lot of information here and it’s easy to get lost in the data. So, 
to make sure you are using the right data to answer the business questions, how did I tackle this problem?
Well I approached it in 5 steps:

- Data understanding - the key to success on any data project is to understand
the data in detail. So we took the time to understand the data model and
domain of your business.

- Data cleaning - after understanding your business, we then cleaned the
available datasets and thought about what an ideal dataset should look like for
this problem.

-Data modelling - After ensuring the data was clean for analysis, we needed
to process and model this data into a dataset that can precisely answer the
business questions and produce the results needed.

- Data analysis - With our new dataset, we used our analytical expertise to
uncover insights from this dataset and to produce visualizations to describe the
insights.

And finally we used these insights to unlock business decisions and to make
recommendations on next steps.
